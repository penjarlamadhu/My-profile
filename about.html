    <h2>Here’s your "About Me" with a more personal tone:</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a second-year B.Sc. Computer Science student at Osmania University, passionate about building a career in tech with a focus on product-based companies. I completed my intermediate education at Vagdevi Junior College and schooling at Telangana State Model School.
        
        As a full-stack web developer, I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and SQLite, and currently working on advancing my JavaScript expertise. I’m also enrolled in a few online courses, including front-end development and Next Wave’s web development program, and recently completed an NPTEL course in Java. <br><br>
        
        I’m dedicated to enhancing my resume and LinkedIn profile by building a project every week, and I aim to secure certifications from companies like Meta or Google. Improving my English fluency is another goal, so I make a point to expand my vocabulary regularly. <br><br>
        
        When it comes to tech specs, I prefer laptops with HX processors, and I’ve set up my projects in a dedicated folder on my PC, ready for integration with GitHub. Additionally, I’m preparing a CV tailored to Tata Steel to open new opportunities for my career path.
