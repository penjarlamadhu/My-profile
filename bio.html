            <h2>About Me.....</h2>
            <p><strong>Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | B.Sc. Computer Science at Osmania University</strong></p>
            <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science student and passionate full-stack developer currently pursuing my B.Sc. at Osmania University. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and SQLite, I’m now focused on expanding my expertise in JavaScript, SQL, and front-end technologies. Driven by a commitment to continuous learning, I regularly challenge myself to complete a new project every week, strengthening my skills and enriching my portfolio.</p>
            <p>I am also actively working toward certifications from top companies like Meta and Google, aiming to shape a career in high-impact, product-driven tech roles. Recently, I completed an NPTEL course in Java, which has further deepened my knowledge in programming fundamentals and object-oriented concepts.</p>
            <p>In the journey of growth and achievement, every challenge is an opportunity, and every setback a lesson. Greatness isn’t about instant success; it’s built through resilience, hard work, and a commitment to learning every day. Stay focused on your goals, trust the process, and never underestimate the power of small, consistent efforts. Embrace each day with a mindset to grow, not just in skills but in confidence and resilience. Remember, the only limits are the ones we set for ourselves – so dream big, work hard, and let your passion pave the way to success!
